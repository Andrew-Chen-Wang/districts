## United States Districts

GeoJSON and other shape files for the legislative districts and states of the US.

Supported formats:

* GeoJSON (todo)
* TopoJSON (todo)
* KML
* Shapefile (todo)

## Using the shapes

All files in this repository are automatically published to [theunitedstates.io](http://theunitedstates.io), at predictable URLs.

For example, a KML for New York's 1st district can be found at:

> [http://theunitedstates.io/districts/current/cds/kml/NY-1.kml](http://theunitedstates.io/districts/current/cds/kml/NY-1.kml)

`current` will always point to the current shape of that district. Districts change approximately every 10 years.

You can also download [the entire set as a ZIP file](https://github.com/unitedstates/districts/archive/gh-pages.zip), and use them however you like. If you plan on using these for heavy traffic, or you want control over the domain name they live on, you should use this method.

## Other resources

These are just static shapes. If you want to do more, you might use:

* The [US Census Bureau's API](http://www.census.gov/developers/)
* GovTrack's [Boundary Service API](http://gis.govtrack.us/map/demo/cd-2012/)
