## United States Districts

GeoJSON and other shape files for the federal and state legislative districts of the US.

Supported formats:

* GeoJSON (todo)
* TopoJSON (todo)
* KML (only federal, state-level todo)
* Shapefile (todo)

## Using the shapes

All files in this repository are automatically published to [theunitedstates.io](http://theunitedstates.io), at predictable URLs.

For example, a KML for New York's 1st district can be found at:

> [http://theunitedstates.io/districts/cds/2012/kml/NY-1.kml](http://theunitedstates.io/districts/cds/2012/kml/NY-1.kml)

The `2012` here refers to the year that these districts came into effect, and is the most current districts.

A KML for the state of New York can be found at:

> [http://theunitedstates.io/districts/states/kml/NY.kml](http://theunitedstates.io/districts/states/kml/NY.kml)

You can also download [the entire set as a ZIP file](https://github.com/unitedstates/districts/archive/gh-pages.zip), and use them however you like. If you plan on using these for heavy traffic, or you want control over the domain name they live on, you should use this method.

## Other resources
